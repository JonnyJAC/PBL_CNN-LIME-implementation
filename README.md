# PBL_CNN-LIME-implementation

This is the code for the task research of a PBL course, which includes a simple code implementation of **ResNet+LIME**.

**MedMNIST_ Training_ Evaluation. ipynb** contains all the required code for running and outputting results

The required environment for operation is the same as [MedMnist](https://github.com/MedMNIST/experiments) as shown

Apart from following the guidance of [MedMnist](https://github.com/MedMNIST/experiments)，

all code implementations are implemented by the uploader **personally**，and **only** use for academic research
